# TestPlanIt Jira App - Marketplace Release Guide

## Changes Made for Production Readiness

The Forge app supports **customer-hosted TestPlanIt instances** on `*.testplanit.com` subdomains. Users install the app from the marketplace and configure their own TestPlanIt URL and API key.

### Key Changes:

1. **Configuration Page** - Admin settings page at `Apps → TestPlanIt Settings` for URL + API key
2. **API Key Authentication** - Forge app sends `X-Forge-Api-Key` header; backend validates with timing-safe comparison
3. **Dynamic URLs** - Uses Forge Storage API to save instance URL per Jira installation
4. **Wildcard Permissions** - Manifest allows connections to any `*.testplanit.com` subdomain
5. **Optimized Bundle** - Settings page uses selective lucide-react imports (~184KB vs ~729KB)

## User Setup Instructions (to include in docs)

### IMPORTANT: Domain Requirements

**The marketplace version of this app ONLY works with `*.testplanit.com` subdomains.**

This is due to Atlassian Forge security requirements that mandate explicit domain whitelisting in the app manifest.

#### ✅ Supported Configurations (Marketplace App):
- `https://demo.testplanit.com`
- `https://allego.testplanit.com`
- `https://yourcompany.testplanit.com`
- Any subdomain of `testplanit.com`

#### ❌ NOT Supported (Marketplace App):
- `https://testplanit.yourcompany.com`
- `https://custom-domain.com`
- `http://localhost:3000`
- Any domain that is not a subdomain of `testplanit.com`

### For Self-Hosted Custom Domains

**If you run TestPlanIt on your own domain** (not a `*.testplanit.com` subdomain), you must:

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Update `manifest.yml`** with your domain:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     external:
       fetch:
         backend:
           - 'your-domain.com'
           - '*.your-domain.com'
         client:
           - 'your-domain.com'
           - '*.your-domain.com'
       images:
         - 'your-domain.com'
         - '*.your-domain.com'
   ```
3. **Create your own Forge app** at https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/
4. **Update the app ID** in `manifest.yml` with your new app ID
5. **Build and deploy** using the instructions in this README
6. **Install on your Jira** instance using `forge install`

**Note:** You cannot use the marketplace version if you self-host on a custom domain.

---

### For Jira Administrators (Using Marketplace App):

1. **Verify** your TestPlanIt instance uses a `*.testplanit.com` subdomain
2. **Install the app** from Atlassian Marketplace
3. Go to **Settings (gear icon) → Apps → TestPlanIt Settings**
4. Enter your TestPlanIt instance URL (e.g., `https://demo.testplanit.com`)
5. Generate a Forge API key in TestPlanIt (Admin > Integrations > Jira > Forge API Key)
6. Paste the API key in the settings page
7. Click **Test Connection** to verify the URL is accessible
8. Click **Save Configuration**

### For End Users:

1. Navigate to any Jira issue
2. Find the **TestPlanIt** panel on the right side

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Forge Custom UI
- **Backend**: Forge Resolver functions
- **Storage**: Forge Storage API (per-installation)
- **Build**: Webpack 5 with Babel

### Files Modified

- [manifest.yml](manifest.yml) - Added admin page, updated permissions
- [src/index.js](src/index.js) - Added storage functions, dynamic URLs
- [src/frontend/app.jsx](src/frontend/app.jsx) - Updated to use dynamic URLs
- [src/frontend/settings.jsx](src/frontend/settings.jsx) - New configuration UI
- [webpack.config.js](webpack.config.js) - Multi-entry build config

### API Endpoints Used

Your app calls these TestPlanIt endpoints:

- `GET /version.json` - Connection testing (returns app version)
- `GET /api/integrations/jira/test-info` - Fetch linked test data (requires `X-Forge-Api-Key` header)

The `test-info` endpoint validates the API key against the `forgeApiKey` stored in the Jira integration's settings. Make sure these endpoints are available in all TestPlanIt instances.

---

## Troubleshooting

### App not loading in Jira
- Check Forge logs: `pnpm exec forge logs`
- Verify deployment: `pnpm exec forge environments list`

### Connection test failing
- Verify TestPlanIt instance is accessible
- Check CORS configuration on TestPlanIt
- Ensure `/api/health` endpoint exists

### Links not working
- Verify instance URL has no trailing slash
- Check browser console for errors
- Test direct URL in browser
