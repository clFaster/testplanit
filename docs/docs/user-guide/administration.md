# Administration

This section provides an overview of the administration features available in TestPlanIt. As an administrator, you can manage users, configure global settings, and maintain the overall application environment.

## Accessing Administration

To access the administration settings, you must be logged in as a user with administrative privileges.

1. Click the Admin link in the top navigation bar.

The top navigation bar will turn red indicating you are in an Administrative section of the application.

If you do not see an option to access Admin settings, you may not have the necessary permissions. Contact your system administrator if you believe you should have access.
