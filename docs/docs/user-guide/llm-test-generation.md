# AI-Powered Test Case Generation

Generate comprehensive test cases from requirements, issues, and documentation using AI.

## Prerequisites

Before using AI test generation, ensure:

- At least one active LLM integration is configured
- At least one active issue tracking integration (for issue-based generation)
- Project has test case templates configured
- User has appropriate permissions for test case creation

## Generation Wizard

The AI test generation wizard guides you through a 4-step process:

### Step 1: Select Source

Choose your test generation source:

**From Issue:**

- Select an existing issue from your integrated tracking system
- Issues are automatically fetched with full context including descriptions and comments
- Supports Jira, GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps work items

**From Document:**

- Enter requirements directly into the form
- Provide title, description, and priority
- Ideal for early-stage requirements or internal specifications

### Step 2: Select Template

- Choose the test case template to use for generated cases
- All template fields are displayed for review
- Select which fields to populate with AI-generated content
- Required fields are automatically included
- Optional fields can be included or excluded based on your needs

### Step 3: Configure Generation

**Quantity Options:**

- **Just One**: Generate a single, comprehensive test case
- **A Couple**: Generate 2-3 focused test cases
- **A Few**: Generate 3-5 test cases covering different scenarios
- **Several**: Generate 5-8 test cases with good coverage
- **Many**: Generate 8-12 test cases for thorough testing
- **Maximum**: Generate comprehensive test suite (12+ cases)

**Additional Instructions:**

- Provide specific guidance for the AI
- Example: "Focus on security testing scenarios"
- Common suggestions available as quick-add buttons:
  - Security testing
  - Edge cases
  - Happy path scenarios
  - Mobile compatibility
  - API testing
  - Accessibility testing

**Auto-Generate Tags:**

- Enable to automatically create and assign relevant tags
- Tags are generated based on test content and context
- Existing tags are reused when appropriate

### Step 4: Review and Import

- Review all generated test cases
- Each case shows:
  - Name and description
  - Generated test steps (if applicable)
  - Populated template fields
  - Generated tags (if enabled)
  - Priority and automation status
- Select specific test cases to import
- Bulk select/deselect options available

## Generation Process

When you click "Generate":

1. **Context Analysis**: The AI analyzes the source material and existing test cases
2. **Template Processing**: Template fields and requirements are processed
3. **Content Generation**: Test cases are generated based on your specifications
4. **Field Population**: Custom fields are populated with relevant content
5. **Tag Generation**: Tags are automatically created (if enabled)
6. **Quality Validation**: Generated content is validated for completeness

## Generated Content Structure

### Test Case Fields

The AI automatically populates:

**Core Fields:**

- **Name**: Descriptive, action-oriented test case names
- **Description**: Detailed test objectives and scope (if template field exists)
- **Priority**: Inferred from source issue priority or requirement importance

**Template Fields:**

- **Preconditions**: Required setup or system state
- **Test Data**: Sample data needed for execution
- **Environment**: Target testing environment
- **Expected Results**: Detailed expected outcomes
- **Post-conditions**: Expected system state after testing

**System Fields:**

- **Steps**: Detailed action/expected result pairs
- **Tags**: Contextually relevant tags
- **Automated**: Suggestion for automation potential
- **Estimate**: Time estimate based on complexity

### Test Steps Format

Generated test steps follow a consistent structure:

```text
Step 1: Navigate to the login page
Expected Result: Login form is displayed with username and password fields

Step 2: Enter valid credentials (user@test.com / password123)
Expected Result: Credentials are accepted and validated

Step 3: Click the "Login" button
Expected Result: User is redirected to the dashboard
```

## Advanced Features

### Context Awareness

The AI considers:

- **Existing Test Cases**: Avoids duplication of current test scenarios
- **Project Domain**: Understands your application type and testing needs
- **Template Structure**: Adapts content to fit your specific template fields
- **Issue History**: Incorporates comments and updates from linked issues

### Field Selection Optimization

- **Required Fields**: Always populated with essential content
- **Optional Fields**: Can be selectively included based on your workflow
- **Field Types**: Content is formatted appropriately for each field type:
  - Rich text fields receive formatted content
  - Dropdown fields receive valid option values
  - Multi-select fields receive appropriate value arrays

### Intelligent Tagging

Auto-generated tags include:

- **Functional Areas**: Based on the feature being tested (e.g., authentication, payment)
- **Test Types**: Based on testing approach (e.g., integration, unit, e2e)
- **Priorities**: Based on issue priority or risk assessment
- **Platforms**: Based on mentioned platforms or environments

## Best Practices

### Source Material Quality

1. **Detailed Issues**: More detailed issues produce better test cases
2. **Clear Requirements**: Well-written requirements lead to comprehensive test coverage
3. **Include Context**: Add comments or descriptions that explain business logic
4. **Specify Constraints**: Mention any technical limitations or dependencies

### Template Configuration

1. **Field Naming**: Use descriptive field names that clearly indicate their purpose
2. **Field Types**: Choose appropriate field types for different content types
3. **Required vs Optional**: Mark fields as required only if they're truly essential
4. **Field Ordering**: Arrange fields logically in the template

### Generation Settings

1. **Start Small**: Begin with fewer test cases and adjust based on quality
2. **Review Carefully**: Always review generated content before importing
3. **Iterate**: Use additional instructions to refine generation
4. **Tag Strategy**: Develop a consistent tagging strategy for your project

### Quality Assurance

1. **Review Generated Steps**: Ensure test steps are executable and complete
2. **Validate Field Content**: Check that generated content fits field constraints
3. **Test Data Verification**: Ensure generated test data is appropriate and valid
4. **Link Verification**: Confirm that generated test cases properly link to source issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No AI providers available:**

- Verify that at least one LLM integration is configured and active
- Check that the integration is assigned to your project
- Confirm your user has appropriate permissions

**Generation fails with timeout:**

- Try reducing the quantity of test cases to generate
- Simplify additional instructions
- Check API rate limits for your provider

**Poor quality test cases:**

- Provide more detailed source material
- Add specific instructions about testing focus
- Review and refine your template field definitions
- Consider using a more capable AI model

**Fields not populating correctly:**

- Verify field types in your template
- Check field naming and descriptions
- Ensure selected fields are appropriate for AI generation

### Error Messages

**"No AI model is configured"**

- Add an LLM integration in project settings
- Ensure the integration is active and properly configured

**"API quota exceeded"**

- Your AI provider's usage limits have been reached
- Wait for quota reset or upgrade your plan
- Consider switching to a different provider

**"Invalid API configuration"**

- Check API keys and credentials
- Verify the model name is correct
- Test the integration connection

### Performance Optimization

1. **Model Selection**: Balance quality needs with response time
2. **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple test cases in single requests when possible
3. **Field Selection**: Only populate fields you actually need
4. **Template Optimization**: Streamline templates for AI generation
