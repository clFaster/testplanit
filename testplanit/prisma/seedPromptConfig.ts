CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no comments, no text before or after the JSON.

JSON structure (EXACT format required):
{
  "testCases": [
    {
      "name": "Test case name/title",
      "description": "Optional description or summary of the test case",
      "preconditions": "Optional prerequisites or setup requirements",

    }
  ]
}

PARSING RULES:
- Extract ALL test cases found in the document
- For heading-based documents: each major heading typically defines a separate test case
- For table-based documents: each row typically defines a separate test case
- For documents with only one logical test case: return an array with a single test case
- Identify steps, expected results, preconditions, tags, and descriptions from any format
- If steps have expected results (via "->", "|", or separate sections), include them
- If a section name doesn't match a known field, include it as a custom key on the test case
- Preserve the original content as closely as possible (don't rewrite or summarize)
- If the document has no clear test case structure, treat the whole content as a single test case with the content as the description

REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate {{QUANTITY_GUIDANCE}} test cases that are SPECIFIC to the provided issue
- Each test case name should reference the actual feature/functionality being tested

{{PRIORITY_INSTRUCTION}}
- CRITICAL: ALL REQUIRED FIELDS must be included in fieldValues with meaningful content
- IMPORTANT: Include ALL optional fields in fieldValues, especially text fields like Description, Preconditions, and Post Conditions
- For text/textarea fields (Description, Preconditions, Post Conditions, etc.):
  * Always provide substantial, detailed content (minimum 2-3 sentences)
  * Include specific details relevant to the issue being tested
  * Description should explain what the test validates and why it's important
  * Preconditions should list all prerequisites needed before testing
  * Post Conditions should describe the expected system state after the test
- For single-select fields with options, use exactly one of the provided options
- For multiselect fields, provide an array of 1-3 relevant options from the list
- CRITICAL: Never create new option values for dropdown/select fields - always use provided options exactly
{{TAG_INSTRUCTIONS}}
- DO NOT create generic test cases - they must validate the specific issue requirements
- DO NOT leave optional text fields empty - they provide critical context for test execution
- IMPORTANT: If existing test cases are provided, DO NOT generate duplicates or test cases that cover the same scenarios. Focus on NEW test scenarios not already covered.

SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Match test cases to the test run name, description, documentation, linked issues, and tags
- Include all test scenarios that may need to be executed to validate the test run's purpose
- Consider test case tags and folder organization for relevance
- Prioritize test cases that directly relate to the functionality being tested
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios when applicable
- ONLY return IDs from the provided repository - never invent case IDs

IMPORTANT:
- If no test cases match the criteria, return an empty array: {"caseIds": [], "reasoning": "No matching test cases found"}
- Be thorough but selective - include cases that are truly relevant, not just tangentially related
- Consider the folder structure as context for what area of functionality a test case covers
